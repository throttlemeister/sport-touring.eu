      <description>About a month ago, KDE released their much anticipated next major release of the KDE desktop environment, version 6. The only distributions using it soon after were (obviously) KDE Neon, the KDE showcase / development platform, and the rolling release distributions like Arch and OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. The scheduled release distributions will only ship KDE6 in their next new release.&#xA;As it was released, obviously there were some teething problems despite a long and extensive beta test cycle and lots of bigfixing.</description>

      <title>OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, 6 months in</title>

      <description>Well, here we are, 6 months after installing OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and still no urge to change. The only change I am longing for is the update to KDE Plasma 6, which should be coming soon now that it has officially been released.&#xA;Since there are basically no updates since my last post in December, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much to say. I did however made some changes. A couple of weeks ago, my GTX1080 decided to shit itself such that it triggers the short protection in the power supply so that&amp;rsquo;s out.</description>

      <title>OpenSUSE: 4 months in</title>

      <description>Maybe it is time for a little update, even if there is not much to say. After 4 months of running OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, I can honestly say I have not had a single moment where I&amp;rsquo;d thought I should maybe look for another distribution because XYZ is getting too annoying.&#xA;Of course it does have some annoyances. Some are with me, like running systemd-boot while it is not officially ready for primetime yet.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Linux for desktop performance</title>

      <description>My daily driver is currently Pop!_OS, which is a desktop Linux distribution. It&amp;rsquo;s a very nice distribution, really good with Nvidia hardware (which isn&amp;rsquo;t a given on Linux) and, to me, a Gnome look that is very close to what I want so my GUI changes are minimal.&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s less, and that is a more generic Linux problem, is that particularly the Linux kernel is optimized for server use and not desktop.</description>

      <title>Moving a Linux install to a new disk</title>

      <description>Recently I had to move my Linux install from one drive to another, as I was experiencing some issues with a WD SN550 nvme drive causing some short random freezes of the GUI with IO intensive tasks. Since I also have a Samsung nvme drive installed, I decided to see if the problem persists on the other drive.&#xA;But. Having a fully configured and customized Linux install is a pain in the behind to redo.</description>

      <title>Did you know... (or, RHEL on LXC/LXD)</title>

      <description>There are no RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) LXC/LXD container images publicly available? There are LXC/LXD container images available for CentOS and Fedora? You can convert a CentOS install to RHEL using the Convert2RHEL tool? This also works for a LXC/LXD container? You will need to do this if you want to run RHEL on Proxmox in a LXC container? You can create a tarbal of a running system to import into a vanilla LXC/LXD installation?</description>

      <description>Introduction WSL 2 on Windows 10 introduced the ability to run a native linux kernel on your computer while using Windows 10 as your main operating system. Instead of emulating a Linux kernel, like WSL 1 does, WSL 2 uses a lightweight hypervisor to run linux in parallel with Windows.&#xA;To be able to run WSL 2 on Windows 10, installation of Windows 10 feature update 2004 is required.&#xA;An explanation on how to enable WSL2 support can be found on the page detailing how to create a Gentoo instance on WSL2.</description>
