      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, I have been monitoring my network and homelab using Observium. This worked and does work very well. Observium is very good at what it does. However, there are a couple of things that do not work so well for me using Observium:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Observium does not let me add applications to monitor very easily or at all&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Observium is limited to what can be offered through SNMP&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Observium is not open source and as such it cannot be modified or changed to your needs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Observium is not an application I have come across in my professional life, so knowing how it works does not help me professionally.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That last bit is obviously not a necessity, however I do feel it&amp;rsquo;s always a nice thing to be able to apply things you have learned in your homelab into your professional environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
