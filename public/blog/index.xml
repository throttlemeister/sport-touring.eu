      <title>Transactional updates on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s possible to use transactional or atomic updates on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and leveraging the snapshot capabilities of btrfs. It’s actually quite simple; all you need to do is to install the command using zipper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Important prerequisite: the filesystem must be btrfs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo zypper in transactional-update&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will install the command. Next you want to set up some, to prevent some potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Note: this systemd service is required to create RPM dirs in /var as TU &#xA;# does not mount /var in the new snapshot to maintain atomicity.&#xA;systemctl enable --now create-dirs-from-rpmdb.service&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s basically it. Now if you run the command:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Managing dotfiles using stow on Linux</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/dotfiles/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing that’s always a bit of a pain when you use multiple computers, or when you want to reinstall your computer at some point in time is that you have to recreate your configuration files or ‘dotfiles’ to have everything back as you want again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several ways of doing this, but recently I came across a little tool called GNU stow. It is a much easier way of managing dotfiles than for instance using a git bare repository.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6: Don’t be fooled by the naysayers on the internet</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a month ago, KDE released their much anticipated next major release of the KDE desktop environment, version 6. The only distributions using it soon after were (obviously) KDE Neon, the KDE showcase / development platform, and the rolling release distributions like Arch and OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. The scheduled release distributions will only ship KDE6 in their next new release.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As it was released, obviously there were some teething problems despite a long and extensive beta test cycle and lots of bigfixing. Some of these were:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, 6 months in</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/opensuse-tumbleweed-6-months-in/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/opensuse-tumbleweed-6-months-in/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, here we are, 6 months after installing OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and still no urge to change. The only change I am longing for is the update to KDE Plasma 6, which should be coming soon now that it has officially been released.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since there are basically no updates since my last post in &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/opensuse/opensuse-4-months-in/&#34;&gt;December&lt;/a&gt;, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much to say. I did however made some changes. A couple of weeks ago, my GTX1080 decided to shit itself such that it triggers the short protection in the power supply so that&amp;rsquo;s out. Bit of a pain since everything is water cooled. I ended up replacing it with a Sapphire R9 390 Nitro which is an AMD based card. Raw speed is about half of that of the GTX1080, but at 50 euros it was cheap and being AMD means no more Nvidia issues on Linux as limited as they were for me. Main issue for me was that I had to manually recreate the initrd whenever a new driver version was released to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>systemd-boot on OpenSUSE</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/sdboot/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am weird sometimes, I know. Ever since I used Pop!OS, which uses systemd-boot as default boot manager, I have fallen in love with it. The simplicity and speed of systemd-boot versus the complexity and bulk of GRUB2 just won me over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mind you, GRUB2 is very good at what it does. It’s just that I don’t need all it does. All I need is to boot my machine, nothing more, nothing less. My laptop, on which I am typing this, only has OpenSUSE installed. No dual boot, nothing. My desktop boots OpenSUSE and FreeBSD at the moment, but they do so from seperate disks with their own bootloader. Nice and simple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OpenSUSE: 4 months in</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is time for a little update, even if there is not much to say. After 4 months of running OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, I can honestly say I have not had a single moment where I&amp;rsquo;d thought I should maybe look for another distribution because XYZ is getting too annoying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course it does have some annoyances. Some are with me, like running systemd-boot while it is not officially ready for primetime yet. Others are with OpenSUSE or my setup, like sometimes an update will bork the system and I have to do a snapper rollback. Fortunately, OpenSUSE makes this a 2 minute job and so far, rolling back the update and installing it again is all that is needed to fix the system and the update.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Interesting (or: first tiling windows manager experience)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other night, I was playing around watching YouTube videos and was watching this one video from Brodie Robertson on how he was now using Hyprland as his daily driver. Usually, I just zone out to other tasks when the topic gets to a tiling window manager, as it is not for me: I have a ultrawide screen on my desktop, with a 3440x1440 resolution and trust me, you do not want to run console fullscreen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>No more Windows. FreeBSD instead.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No, I did not stop running OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. That&amp;rsquo;s still my daily driver. I did however wipe my Windows drive and installed FreeBSD instead. I have used FreeBSD quite a lot way back when, and since I hadn&amp;rsquo;t actually booted into Windows for months, I just decided to install FreeBSD on that drive so I could play with it again after I saw KDE is actively supporting FreeBSD for the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The end to distro-hopping?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/the-end-to-distro-hopping/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I have moved to running Linux basically full time, I have ran Pop!OS, Fedora, Nobara, back to Fedora KDE Spin and now OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. All of them are good distributions and none have any real deal-breakers for me not to want to use them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that I really, really like Tumbleweed was not a given. Quite the contrary. OpenSUSE does it&amp;rsquo;s own thing, so it is a bit of a learning curve if you are used to Debian-based or RedHat-based distributions. It is one of the oldest distributions still operating today, which puts it in the same company as Debian and Slackware. The latter actually being the initial origins for (then) SUSE Linux.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a quick post on how to run multiple instances of AdGuard@Home on a single Synology host using Docker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem&lt;/strong&gt;: you cannot easily, using Docker, run multiple instances of the same program - or different program - while listening on the same port.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: do not use host or bridge networking, but put the container on the same network as the host using macvlan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, we need to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why the F1 Academy is bad for women in racing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before the start of the 2023 F1 season, Formula 1 launched the F1 Academy initiative to be headed by Susie Wolf and get more girls into F1. It is a girl-only series racing on the same tracks F1 is racing. While this is a noble cause, it is my opinion this is the wrong thing to do and it is to the detriment of all girls and women in racing. It will show women as less than men in racing and ultimately achieve the exact opposite of what it wants to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New laptop, new Linux distro</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally got fed up with my Macbook Pro as a Linux laptop. It was a 2012 model, no longer supported by Apple. But the quirky implementation of Nvidia discrete graphics on the Macbook wasn&amp;rsquo;t the best for reliable Linux operation. Mind you, Nvidia is always a bit of a challenge, but Apple being Apple certainly does not help in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I am currently sporting a Lenovo T460 from 2016. Still not really a new laptop, but fast enough for Linux and most things I do with it. It has a i5 6300U from the Skylake family of processors, 8GB memory (for now, supports up to 32GB) and a 1TB SSD. For graphics it used the Intel 520&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Upgraded laptop to Fedora 36</title>

Libadwaita is not as bad as I thought it to be, and it actually looks really good. I wish they had taken the time and effort to create a GTK3 theme for applications that are not libadwaita aware, but fortunately someone else did. It does look horribly inconsistent without. Bad move.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other than this, I do not miss the theming at the moment now that I added some transparency in the top bar and dock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Optimizing Linux for desktop performance</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My daily driver is currently Pop!_OS, which is a desktop Linux distribution. It&amp;rsquo;s a very nice distribution, really good with Nvidia hardware (which isn&amp;rsquo;t a given on Linux) and, to me, a Gnome look that is very close to what I want so my GUI changes are minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s less, and that is a more generic Linux problem, is that particularly the Linux kernel is optimized for server use and not desktop. It prioritizes throughput over latency, which is great for raw performance but less if you expect a smooth, fast GUI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Moving a Linux install to a new disk</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/moving-a-linux-install-to-a-new-disk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I had to move my Linux install from one drive to another, as I was experiencing some issues with a WD SN550 nvme drive causing some short random freezes of the GUI with IO intensive tasks. Since I also have a Samsung nvme drive installed, I decided to see if the problem persists on the other drive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But. Having a fully configured and customized Linux install is a pain in the behind to redo. I did not want to clone, because I made a mistake during install the previous time and it installed in legacy MBR mode, so I wanted to do a proper install using UEFI mode. But preferably not having to re-do all the setup and customizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Monitoring your network or homelab using Zabbix and Grafana</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, I have been monitoring my network and homelab using Observium. This worked and does work very well. Observium is very good at what it does. However, there are a couple of things that do not work so well for me using Observium:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Observium does not let me add applications to monitor very easily or at all&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Observium is limited to what can be offered through SNMP&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Observium is not open source and as such it cannot be modified or changed to your needs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Observium is not an application I have come across in my professional life, so knowing how it works does not help me professionally.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That last bit is obviously not a necessity, however I do feel it&amp;rsquo;s always a nice thing to be able to apply things you have learned in your homelab into your professional environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>As short as possible: application containers, system containers, virtualization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, there is a bit of confusion as to what the difference is between application containers (Docker, Podman, K8S, OpenShift), system containers (LXC/LXD) and virtualization (KVM, Vmware, Hyper-V, Xen) and when you should use them. I will try to explain the differences as short as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;application-containers&#34;&gt;Application containers&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Application containers are created with the most minimal environment to run a specific application. This includes the OS and all dependencies for that application. Every tool or program normally present in the OS that is not needed to run the application is typically left out so that the container image is a small as possible and performs as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are no RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) LXC/LXD container images publicly available?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There are LXC/LXD container images available for CentOS and Fedora?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can convert a CentOS install to RHEL using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://access.redhat.com/articles/2360841&#34;&gt;Convert2RHEL&lt;/a&gt; tool?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This also works for a LXC/LXD container?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will need to do this if you want to run RHEL on Proxmox in a LXC container?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can create a tarbal of a running system to import into a vanilla LXC/LXD installation?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You will need to create a metafile.tar.gz with a few lines of information about the tarbal to do this?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can also use an export from a Docker container to get the system?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And that you can also use an export from a WSL distribution for this?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This means you can set up a WSL environment on your Windows box (see other posts here) just the way you want with all the tools you need, and you can export it to run it independently in a LXC/LXD container as a server?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s not that difficult and really there is no reason why you should not have the Linux distribution of your choice available under WSL2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt; WSL 2 on Windows 10 introduced the ability to run a native linux kernel on your computer while using Windows 10 as your main operating system. Instead of emulating a Linux kernel, like WSL 1 does, WSL 2 uses a lightweight hypervisor to run linux in parallel with Windows.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;To be able to run WSL 2 on Windows 10, installation of Windows 10 feature update 2004 is required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An explanation on how to enable WSL2 support can be found on the page detailing how to create a Gentoo instance on WSL2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
