Maybe it is time for a little update, even if there is not much to say. After 4 months of running OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, I can honestly say I have not had a single moment where I'd thought I should maybe look for another distribution because XYZ is getting too annoying.

Of course it does have some annoyances. Some are with me, like running systemd-boot while it is not officially ready for primetime yet. Others are with OpenSUSE or my setup, like sometimes an update will bork the system and I have to do a snapper rollback. Fortunately, OpenSUSE makes this a 2 minute job and so far, rolling back the update and installing it again is all that is needed to fix the system and the update.

Other than that, I can't even really think of anything. It just works. It runs, it runs fast, I have all the latest packages as you can expect using a rolling release and I just get to enjoy using my computer and play around with it. Both my desktop as well as my laptop.

It's nice to be able to use the computers without this itch or little doubt that makes one go and look for greener pastures.

I'm still impressed, really impressed with OpenSUSE. More should be using it, it really is that good. And a bit of counterweight to the giants like Canonical and Redhat would be nice too.

Have a good one.
