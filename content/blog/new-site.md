After building and setting up my new computer and subsequent move away from the Apple Mac ecosystem, I was left with an issue that the site I had built was setup using a Mac-only tool and could not be migrated to Windows. After mucking around with different tools on Windows and hacking things together, I have now decided to go platform independent and recreate my website using the ever popular WordPress CMS.

Setting it up on the Synology was a breeze and after finding a suitable theme for my needs I have now started to get things up and running again, adding the content, etc. So far, it looks pretty ok and this may indeed be the way to go.
