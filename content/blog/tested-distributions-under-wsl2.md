The following distributions I have installed/created, tested and used under WSL2 and Windows 10.

1. [Alpine Linux](https://www.crashdot.com/posts/wsl/any-linux-distribution-on-windows-10-with-wsl2/); extremely tiny; created from Docker image
2. [AlmaLinux](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux-deploy); migrated from CentOS using AlmaLinux migration tool
3. [Arch Linux](https://www.crashdot.com/posts/wsl/any-linux-distribution-on-windows-10-with-wsl2/); created from virtual machine install
4. [CentOS 7](https://github.com/wsldl-pg/CentWSL); created from rootfs image, then upgraded to latest version
5. CentOS 8; Upgraded from CentOS7
6. CentOS Stream; upgraded from from CentOS8 install
7. [Deepin Linux](https://www.crashdot.com/posts/wsl/any-linux-distribution-on-windows-10-with-wsl2/); created from virtual machine install
8. Debian 10 (Buster); Microsoft Store
9. Debian Testing (Bullseye); upgraded from official Debian 10 release
10. Devuan; migrated from Debian as installed from the Microsoft Store
11. [Fedora](https://www.crashdot.com/posts/wsl/any-linux-distribution-on-windows-10-with-wsl2/); created from virtual machine installation
12. [Gentoo](https://www.crashdot.com/posts/gentoo-on-wsl2/); compiled from source using Stage3 tarball/rootfs iamge
13. Kali Linux; Microsoft Store
14. [Oracle Linux](https://linux.oracle.com/switch/centos/); migrated from CentOS instance using CentOS migration tool from Oracle
15. [RedHat Enterprise Linux](https://www.crashdot.com/posts/wsl/any-linux-distribution-on-windows-10-with-wsl2/); created from virtual machine installation
17. [Rocky Linux](https://github.com/rocky-linux/rocky-tools/tree/main/migrate2rocky); migrated from CentOS using RockyLinux migration tool
18. Ubuntu; Microsoft Store
19. [Slackware](https://www.crashdot.com/posts/wsl/any-linux-distribution-on-windows-10-with-wsl2/); created from Docker image

As you can see, if you can find your favorite distribution in the Microsoft Store, great, if not or if its only available as a paid distribution, just bake your own. It's not that difficult and really there is no reason why you should not have the Linux distribution of your choice available under WSL2.
