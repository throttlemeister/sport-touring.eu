I have a big hobby. It is riding my motorcycle. I ride all over Europe and currently it is BMW Motorrad providing the best tools for the job for me. Sometime for just the thrill of riding exciting roads like the Alps, sometimes to see the interesting sites there are to see. This is a large part of what you will find on these pages. My R1100S and K1200S motorcycles, my travel adventures, my photography.

I have been to Holland (my home country), Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, England, Wales, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Czech, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, Albania, Croatia and Bosnia. Damn, this is becoming a long list&#8230; It‚Äôs probably shorter to mention that I have essentially been to every country in Europe except for some Eastern European countries and Russia. All on my motorcycle of course. üôÇ

And I am not done yet.

When I get back from a trip, I already have new ideas floating around in my head for a new one. Mostly I am restricted by the time I can take off from work.

Unfortunately, I am also a bit of a geek. That means that putting the site together technically is typically more interesting than putting in actual content&#8230;

If you are still reading, and you are wondering about the origins of my nicknames:

>‚Äúthrottlemeister‚Äù comes from always riding point with my friends, and as such dictating the pace on trips

>‚ÄúMo‚ÄôGas‚Äù comes from me always being the first one running on empty, and needing more gas
